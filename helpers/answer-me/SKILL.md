# Answer Me

## Role

`answer-me` is an optional collaborator for evidence gathering.

It is not part of the default `session-distill` main chain and must not block the main chain when unavailable.

Use it when a memory draft is plausible but does not yet have enough supporting evidence from code, docs, config, tests, command output, or repo history.

## Main Chain Boundary

The durable memory promotion chain remains the unified MCP candidate loop:

```text
prepare_session_distill(client="auto") -> session-distill -> suggest_* -> list_candidates -> auto-review / confirm / reject -> final summary
```

`answer-me` can provide missing evidence during candidate review, but it does not approve, reject, or sync memory entries.

## When To Use

- A draft cites a repo behavior but lacks a file or command reference.
- A conflict needs a concrete source comparison.
- A review note says the claim is under-evidenced.
- A candidate should remain local-only unless stronger evidence exists.

## Expected Output

Return a compact evidence answer with:

- direct answer
- supporting files, commands, or docs
- uncertainty or missing evidence
- whether the evidence supports `new`, `refine`, `confirm`, `conflict`, or `ephemeral`

## Non-Goals

- Do not promote memory entries.
- Do not create candidate or durable memory entries.
- Do not rewrite draft conclusions beyond evidence-scoped wording.
- Do not make `session-distill` depend on this skill.
