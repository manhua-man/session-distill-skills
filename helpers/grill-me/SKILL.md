# Grill Me

## Role

`grill-me` is an optional collaborator for review-stage pressure testing.

It is not part of the default `session-distill` main chain and must not block the main chain when unavailable.

Use it when a candidate conclusion is high-risk, broad, ambiguous, or likely to become durable project guidance.

## Main Chain Boundary

The durable memory promotion chain remains the unified MCP candidate loop:

```text
prepare_session_distill(client="auto") -> session-distill -> suggest_* -> list_candidates -> auto-review / confirm / reject -> final summary
```

`grill-me` can be called during candidate review, but it does not approve entries by itself and does not write to the memory backend.

## When To Use

- A draft would change project rules, agent behavior, or user-facing guidance.
- Evidence is present but the conclusion may be overgeneralized.
- A conflict candidate needs a sharper failure-mode analysis.
- A review asks whether a conclusion is product truth, workflow preference, or local-only context.

## Expected Output

Return a short pressure-test note with:

- verdict: keep / narrow / defer / reject
- strongest evidence
- missing evidence
- likely failure modes
- proposed safer wording, if the conclusion should survive

## Non-Goals

- Do not promote memory entries.
- Do not create candidate or durable memory entries.
- Do not make `session-distill` depend on this skill.
- Do not treat lack of `grill-me` as an error.
